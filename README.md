# Shell Scripts

A collection of shell scripts, some of which are useful.

- Some (like `manage_monitors` and `toggle_clipboard_manager`) are bound to hotkeys via `i3` config.
- Some (like `view_in_emacs`) are `alias`ed by my `zsh` config.
- Others (like `add`) don't need to be here at all.

I typically add `./bin/` to `$PATH`.

Feel free to use anything in here.
